# Style guide resources

I am a big fan of technical content style guides. 

In my role as a contributor to blockchain projects, I create and curate Markdown files that provide style guidance. Style guides help ensure consistency. Consistency builds trust. 

I collect style guides and rely on industry standards. When there are several choices of spelling and capitalization, a word list provides recommended wording choices.
