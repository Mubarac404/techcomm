## STC crypto curious questions

Thanks to the STC Florida community for the questions submitted for the March 23, 2022 talk. Like a story I share in the presentation, I am not able to answer all of the questions. Always DYOR (do your own research).

üôä = Not my area of expertise
‚≠ê = Able to speak about

### Q: How does currency relate to the blockchain? Is it that so many units of currency translates to so many units in the blockchain?

Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. 

- üôä Bitcoin is one blockchain. See [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, put a hard cap or maximum limit of 21 million on the supply, regulating supply through an algorithm in its source code. The limited supply makes Bitcoin a scarce commodity and can help increase its price in the future.
- ‚≠ê The Cosmos Hub public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain native staking token is the ATOM. The Cosmos Hub is the first chain on the Cosmos ecosystem. See [What is Cosmos?](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro).

No limit is set on the supply of new ATOM that can be created. Based on the number of ATOM being staked, Cosmos adjusts the amount of tokens created. 2022 inflation rate ~9%. See (Whitepaper - Resources - Cosmos Network](https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper) and [governance proposals](https://forum.cosmos.network/c/governance/16). Some wider discussions are in favor of reducing the inflation rate.

## Tech comm in blockchain

- Comms are essential
- Content has high value
- Communities rely on accurate technical content
- Developers write docs, almost everyone writes docs
- Open source is the norm

## What are the communication needs of the industry? 

‚≠ê Make complex information simple
‚≠ê Uncomplicate a complicated tech stack 

Content requirements exist for every audience: developers, end users, stakeholders, business leaders, decision makers, community members, investors, project and ecosystem governance, open source communities, event managers, and so on.

- Technical documentation
- Learning tutorials
- Code audits
- Code strings
- Research papers
- Presentations
- Tweets
- Rich media: e-learning, videos, talks, classes, courses
- Social comms
- Design
- UX
- UI
- APIs
- SDKs
- And so on

## Tech comm careers in blockchain

A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network. It makes sense that most blockchain companies are also distributed. 

At least 50% of blockchain jobs are remote.

### Job titles to search for

Technical writer, editor, blog writer, copywriter, community manager, developer advocate, social comms, communication manager, external communication, international communications, content strategy, marketing, taxonomist, PR, designer, UI, UX, and more

On March 23, 2022 there are 50 [remote technical writer blockchain jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Technical%20Writer%20Blockchain&remotejob=032b3046-06a3-4876-8dfd-474eb5e7ed11&vjk=3e4765de81574c09) posted on Indeed. On March 20, there were 47 postings.
